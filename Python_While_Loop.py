üìù Task: QuickPedal Fuel Check Simulation

Imagine QuickPedal wants to monitor rider fuel level (instead of speed).

Write a function read_fuel_gauge() that:

Randomly returns a number between 0 and 100 (fuel percentage).

Prints the reading like:

Fuel gauge reading: 35%


Returns the fuel percentage.

Write another function check_fuel_level(limit=20) that:

Calls read_fuel_gauge().

If fuel is less than limit (default 20%), print:

Warning: Low fuel! Please refill.


Otherwise, print:

Fuel level is okay.


Call check_fuel_level() at the end to test it.

üí° Extra Challenge (if you want to push yourself):

Modify check_fuel_level to take rider‚Äôs name as an argument so it prints:

Chika's fuel gauge reading: 10%
Warning: Low fuel! Please refill.
